# ⚛️ React Rumble Event 

Welcome to React Rumble – the ultimate coding duel where innovation meets adrenaline! Step into the arena where your React mastery will be tested in electrifying 1v1 showdowns. In Round 1, harness the power of GPT to quickly craft simple components and build a strong foundation. But when Round 2 arrives, the challenge intensifies: you must rely solely on your own skills to construct intricate components—no AI assistance allowed. Every second counts as you outpace your opponent in a battle of precision, creativity, and sheer coding speed. Gear up, let your React prowess shine, and seize your title as the champion of React Rumble! 🚀

## 📤 Submission Guide

### 1. 🍴 Fork the Repository  
First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account by clicking the **Fork** button in the top right corner of the repo page.  

### 2. 📤 Clone Repository  
Fire up your Git Bash/Terminal and ~steal~ clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YourGitHubUsername>/FunctionalComponents.git
```
### 3. 🌿 Use your roll number as branch name
Once you’ve successfully acquired the repo, create a new branch named after your Roll No. (We know you're special, so make it unique!):
```bash
git checkout -b <YourRollNumber>
```
### 4. 💾 Commit Changes
After completing the tasks, stage changes + write a commit message that’s better than "idk lol":
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "idk lol"
```
### 5. 🚀 Push Branch
Time to send your masterpiece into the wild! Push your branch to the remote repository
```bash
git push origin <YourRollNumber>
```
### 6. 🎉 Create a Pull Request (PR)
1. Go to the GitHub repo.
2. Click “Compare & Pull Request”.
3. Title: [YourRollNumber] I did the thing!
4. Hit send.

Congrats! Your assignment is now someone else’s problem (mine🙂).

## 🏆 Judging Criteria
Your components will be judged on several key aspects: functionality, code quality, user experience, and innovation. The evaluation will consider how effectively your components perform their intended tasks, the clarity and maintainability of your code, and your adherence to best practices in React development. 
Special attention will be given to the efficiency of state management and API integration, as well as robust error handling.

Good luck!
